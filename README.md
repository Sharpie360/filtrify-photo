### What is it?
Filtrify Photo is a beginner friendly code-along project built is Vue.js and Vuex. There are mistakes along the way, but we work through each bug together and you wont miss any code. For the a-bit-more-experienced coders, we will be implementing a CORS proxy running on a simple backend node/express server to ensure we can use any image any user desires.
